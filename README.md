# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
Rock vs Mine Prediction uses sonar data to classify underwater objects. Sonar signals are collected, features are extracted, and machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Neural Networks) are trained to distinguish rocks from mines. Evaluated for accuracy, these models enhance real-time underwater navigation and safety.
